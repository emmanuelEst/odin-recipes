Recipe Website - The Odin Project Assignment

This recipe website was created as a small demonstration of my skills with HTML.
The skills used to make this project are as followed: Boilerplate creation, basic HTML tags like anchor, "img", and "ul"/"ol".
The project is a work in progress and I hope to add more and apply new techniques along with stylesheets and some javascript.

Thanks for taking a look at this project!
